        EQ or emotional intelligence, is a set of skills that you can learn at any time of your life. It’s best described as how much self awareness you have with a mixture of emotional control and maturity.

EQ is different to IQ as it’s not something you can improve by just a few points it’s something you can learn at any time of your life and not just born with. 

It’s very important for self growth and career growth. Studies have shown that a high EQ directly correlates with how well you perform in your career.
