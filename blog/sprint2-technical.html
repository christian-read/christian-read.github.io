      The first thing we want to talk about is what are the differences between the 3?
     
     
      <ul>
         
        <li>Padding: This controls the amount of space between the context/content and it's border.</li>
          <li>Margin: This will control the amount of space between the other content on the page and the border.</li>
          <li>Border: this is a border around an html element (your content or text).</li>
         
      </ul>
   
      <div>
         <center> there are so many ways to use these, but below shows a visual reprsentation of what the three 3 are.
          depending on how you want the format of your website to look like is when you would use these appropiatly. </center>
