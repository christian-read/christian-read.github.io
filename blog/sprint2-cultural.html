I want to live a life surrounded by things that are challenging and technical. I grew up on technology and computers and would love to make that my end goal as a career. I want to have the option to work remotely with a good salary.

I suffer from an anxiety disorder (agoraphobia) and was out of work for about 1 year and a half. I would love to gain back my confidence and relearn how to communicate and how to interview well.

I believe that my limitations are mainly around time management and focus, I struggle so much day to day with these two things. My strengths are that I'm determined, honest and a fast learner.

Joseph has already helped me so much so far, ive been using google and youtube to further help me with the technological struggles i've faced. I've had to schedule time for the gym and spending time with my partner. I feel as if i didnâ€™t have a balance between all three it would through my workflow out of whack.
