Previously when i worked at an orchard, our boss had left for 2 weeks. During those two weeks we had someone leave (he was a backpacker). The boss came back after his holiday and was super impressed with work that had been done. He believed and thought it was me but i had to correct him out of honesty and not wanting to take the credit from someone else even though he wasn’t working there anymore.

My culture is Samoan, we are very kind and sharing people. Growing up samoan has taught me alot about everybody eats mindset and being hospitable. This has shaped me to the person I am today.

A strength and limitation i have into one is Attention deficit disorder. It’s harder to focus then most but we have out of the box thinking and bonus creativity points :). Focus is a big one for me with some things I just can’t for the life of me focus on and other things I'm able to hyperfocus on.

Determination is what I believe will help me through my learning difficulties as I don't give up. I might have a break from something but in the long term I'll never give up on it.

The classic school projects were someone does 90 percent of the work and the others share the last 10 percent. Me and a friend had to help another friend retain his focus, it wasn’t even really a lack of focus but a lack of understanding. Once we helped them figure it out it was smooth sailing from there.
